# NetView

**UPDATE 2022**

It has been a while since we updated the software. In line with its original purpose - the visualization of metadata across population structure using population graphs - we have implemented a new version with `tidyverse`-like syntax: 

https://github.com/esteinig/netviewr

Construction of the underlying population graph and selection of suitable k-nearest-neighbour thresholds is integrated, and there is better documentation and tests. Hopefully it is somewhat easier to use the pipeline going from distance matrices to suitable population network visualizations.

[Code and tutorials](README_OLD.md) in this repository are functional, but will not be maintained.
