# NetView

**Under construction, finished soon!**

NetView is a pipeline for the analysis of genetic structure using mutual k-nearest neighbour graphs (mkNNGs). The main implementation of the pipeline is now availabe in R. 

We decided to move away from Python to enable a more user-friendly access to the main command-line functions, better interface integration with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and visualization of the networks with [networkD3](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/). In addition, we have been working on some ideas to select appropriate parameter values for constructing mkNNGs, combining networks analysis with results from [Admixture]() and implementing community-detection and visualization through [iGraph]().

If you find any bugs or would like to contribute, feel free to contact us or use the issues function on GitHub. 

###Installation
---

```r
require("devtools")
install_github("esteinig/netview")
```

###Dependencies
---

[RStudio]() is highly recommended and the pipeline depends on some great code from the community:

* [cccd]()
* [networkD3]()
* [igraph]()
* [ggplot2]()
* [htmlwidgets]()
* [ape]()
* [reshape2]()
* [RColorBrewer]()
* [gplots]()

###Versions
---

NetView v.1.0

Core calculations in the pipeline are identical to the methods described in the publication for [NetView P]().

For a user-interface with Shiny see [netviewR](https://github.com/esteinig/netviewR). This will be updated and integrated with geographical projections using [geonet]() for R.

For the original Python implementation see [netviewP](https://github.com/esteinig/netviewP). This version will be discontinued, but source code will still be available. We recommend using the current implementation in R.

###Quick Start
---

```r
library(netview)

data(oysterData)
data(oysterMatrix)

oysterOptions <- netviewOptions(....)

graphs <- netview(oysterMatrix, oysterData, k=10:60, step=5, options=oysterOptions)

graphsD3 <- netview(oysterMatrix, oysterData, k=10:60, step=5, networkD3=TRUE, options=oysterOptions)

graphCommunities <- netview(oysterMatrix, oysterData, k=10:60, step=5, cluster=TRUE, options=oysterOptions)

selectionPlot <- plotSelection(graphs, options=oysterOptions)
```

###NetView
---

Network construction, analysis and visualization is accessible via `netview` ( `?netview` ):

```r
netview(distMatrix, metaData, k=10:60, step=5, tree= NULL, cluster=FALSE, mst=FALSE, 
        networkD3=FALSE, save=FALSE, project="netview", options=netviewOptions())
```

######Returns:

* List of network objects in the given range of *k* (`Ç¹etworkD3 = FALSE`)
* Network plots with D3 (`networkD3 = TRUE`)

######Parameters:

```
distMatrix      matrix, symmetrical distance matrix (N x N)
metaData        data frame, meta data ordered as rows in matrix (N)

k               vector of integers, range of parameter k [10:60]
step            integer, step to construct networks through range of k [5]

tree            phylo, rooted phylogeny for cophenetic distance [NULL]

cluster         bool, run community-detection and add to mkNNGs [TRUE]
mst             bool, add edges from minimum spanning tree to mkNNG [FALSE]
networkD3       bool, return list of network visualizations with networkD3 [FALSE]

save            bool, save networks as .gml or .html (D3) to project directory [FALSE]
project         character, directory name in cwd and prefix for saving networks ["netview"]

options         list, list of options from netviewOptions(...)

```

####Input
---

######Quality Control

Shared missing data can introduce artifical similarity between samples when calculating distance matrices from SNPs. We would recommend a missing rate < 10% per sample across SNPs, which can be implemented, through quality control functions as implemented, for instance, in [PLINK](). Likewise, very short or long branch lengths in a phylogeny can introduce artificial similarity during the nearest neighbour search on a cophenetic distance matrix and we recommend to remove such branches prior to network construction. Homogenous sample population sizes are recommended (Neuditschko et al. 2012).

######Distance Matrix

Main input is a symmetrical genetic distance matrix (N x N) using your preferred distance measure. The choice of distance measure is crucial for selecting nearest neighbours to construct the mkNNG. Depending on the purpose of your study, you can, for example, construct simple allele-sharing distances in PLINK, cophenetic distances from a phylogeny (e.g. `cophenetic` from [ape]() in R) or simple Hamming distance over an alignment of SNPs. The matrix input is less specific than the original SNP input in NetView P and allows for flexibility in the type of data (haploid, diploid, genetic or ecologigal data, distance measures) for construction of the mkNNGs.

######Data Frame

The data frame contains at minimum three named columns of meta data for each sample (node) in the matrix: 

* Node ID (`"ID"`)
* Node Colour (`"Colour"`)
* Node Group (`"Group"`)

Colour and group attributes can be used to highlight associated data in the network representation, but are not required for the algorithm to construct the mkNNG. For instance, one could assign colour and population attributes to compare the final genetic structure to the sample populations or geographical locations. Samples in the data frame must be in the same order and number as the rows in the matrix.

####Options
---

Network construction, plots and visualizations can be configured via `netviewOptions` ( `?netviewOptions` ):

```r
defaultOptions <- netviewOptions()
optionsExample <- netviewOptions(mknnWeights=TRUE, nodeGroup="Population")
```

######Parameters:

```
nodeID               character, name of column in data frame containing sample IDs ["ID"]
nodeColour           character, name of column in data frame containing sample colours ["Colour"]
nodeGroup            character, name of column in data frame containing sample group ["Group"]

mknnWeights          include weights (distance) for edges in mkNNG [TRUE]
mknnAlgorithm        choice of mutual k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm (cccd: ?nng ) ["cover_tree"]

clusterAlgorithms    character vector of community algorithms (netview: ?netview) [c("Walktrap", "Infomap", "Fast-Greedy")]

selectionPlot        numeric vector of length [3] for selection ggPlot: k-breaks, n-breaks, line-width [c(20, 5, 1)]
selectionTitle       character, title for selection ggPlot ["K Selection mkNNGs"]

For additional options to configure the visualization with networkD3 see the Documentation ( ?netview )
